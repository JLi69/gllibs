# GLLibs

A collection of useful libraries that I use for making OpenGL projects in C/C++.

For size reasons, I've only included headers and built libraries so that way I
can include this repo as a submodule in my future projects but if you want, all
of the libraries included are open source so you can build them yourself.

## Libraries used:
[GLFW](https://glfw.org) [repo](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

[SOIL2](https://github.com/SpartanJ/SOIL2)

[glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) [repo](https://github.com/dav1dde/glad)
